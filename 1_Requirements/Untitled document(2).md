Record Management System

Introduction:-

The objective of Record Management System is to allow the administrator of

any organization to edit and find out the personal details of a employee/student and

allows them to keep up to date his profile .It’ll also facilitate keeping all

the record of them, such as their id, name, mailing address, phone

number, DOB etc. So all the information about an student will be available in a

few seconds.

Overall, it’ll make Management an easier job for the

administrator and the employee/student of any organization.

Project Overview:-

Search module: Suppose there are hundreds of students and from this we

have to search a particular student and we know the name of the student .In

manual system it is a tedious task though we know the name of the employee/student,

but using this module we can easily search the employee/student by specifying the

name of the student in the search criteria. Thus this module will help the

administrator in searching them with various criteria easily.

Registration Module and Account Management: This module will help the

student get registered from anywhere if internet is present .This module will

really simplify the task of on paper registration. Also after successful

registration the user can update information and change their password as

and when required.

User Management: This module will help the administrator in

enabling/disabling a user account and updating user information as required.

Purpose of project is to maintain details of the students such as storing

information about

SWOT Analysis:

Strength:

●

●

●

The strength of my project is its flexible and secure & reduces man power.

Its cost effective and less time consuming.

We can use this system for multiple purposes.

Weakness:

●

●

This system is only suitable for msme & small institutions.

It’s not fully automated & requires skilled manpower.Opportunity:

● First of all, I want to implement this project in small institutions to get aware about the

effectiveness.

● After getting the data for analysis & user feedback improvements can be done & can be used

widely.

Threats:

●

If the application is not password protected any unauthorized person can

to this application and can make miss use of it.

get access

4W and 1H:

WHY:

● This project will make the work of sellers and customers easier.

● Easy to use.

● Reduces manpower.

● Less time consuming.

● Easy to maintain in future prospect.

WHAT:

●

To update profile via internet.

WHERE:

●

Msme & various institutions

WHEN:

●

While creating profile editing & adding data.

HOW:

Using C programming language, we can provide a flexible code to develop the application and also

provide better service to the customer.

\5. Conclusion

Hence we can conclude that the design phase of the SIMS give us the

information of all the processes used in the project and their relation.
